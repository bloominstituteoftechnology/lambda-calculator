  // Once the state hooks are in place write some functions to hold data in state and update that data depending on what it needs to be doing
  // Your functions should accept a parameter of the the item data being displayed to the DOM (ie - should recieve 5 if the user clicks on
  // the "5" button, or the operator if they click one of those buttons) and then call your setter function to update state.
  // Don't forget to pass the functions (and any additional data needed) to the components as props
